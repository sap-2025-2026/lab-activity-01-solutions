## Lab Activity #01 - 20250926  

- Main Topic: Software Architecture overview (module-1.2)
  - Focus on the MVC architectural pattern
  - Component & Connector (C&C) structure/view - [Lab Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oZprsaZiSVrp5gsNEKnNra0WQ4CWwGY7xwaf7X8YiXg/edit?usp=sharing)
- Practice  
  - Applying MVC: Refactoring an existing unstructured program (a "BBoM") using the MVC architectural pattern
	  - starting program: `bbom.MyApp`
  - Represent the architecture with a C&C view
  - Implement some extensions 
	- adding a new output (view): a GUI 
	- adding a new input: stdin
